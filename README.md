# 8-Ball

## Description  
This is a simple application that generates a random response depending on what number the user is presented with. 

- The motivation for this project was creating an application that utilizes what I learned about conditional statements in Python as a beginner.
- I built this as a fun project
- I learned the basics of conditional statements and where a user is prompted and is then given a response off the program.
